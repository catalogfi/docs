## Welcome to Catalog API

Catalog API is a **Wallet as a Service (WaaS)** platform that provides secure, scalable wallet management for modern applications. We handle the complexity of blockchain interactions so you can focus on building great user experiences.

### What is Wallet as a Service?

With Catalog, users can sign up using their preferred social login (Google, Twitter, Discord, etc.) and we automatically create and manage their blockchain wallets. Users simply tell us what they want to do, and we execute transactions on their behalf - no need for them to understand private keys, gas fees, or blockchain complexity.

### Key Features

- **Social Authentication**: Sign up with Google, Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and more
- **Automatic Wallet Creation**: Wallets are created and managed automatically
- **Transaction Execution**: Execute transactions on behalf of users
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Support for Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Email OTP-based login without passwords
- **Session Management**: Secure token-based authentication with refresh capabilities
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user account and wallet management
- **App Configuration**: Flexible app settings and domain management

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.catalog.fi
```

### Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. The authentication flow typically involves:

1. **Social Login**: User authenticates with their preferred social platform
2. **Wallet Creation**: We automatically create and manage their blockchain wallet
3. **Token Generation**: User receives access tokens for API interactions
4. **Session Management**: Use refresh tokens to maintain sessions

```json
"security": [
  {
    "BearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **OTP Requests**: Limited to prevent abuse
- **Authentication Attempts**: Rate limited for security
- **Transaction Requests**: Limited to prevent excessive blockchain interactions
- **Session Refresh**: Limited to prevent excessive requests

When rate limited, responses include:

- `retry_after`: Seconds to wait before retrying
- `rate_limit_reset`: Timestamp when limits reset

### Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "error_code"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Too Many Requests
